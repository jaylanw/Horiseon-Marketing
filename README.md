# Horiseon-Marketing

A project for a marketing agency.
Recently Horiseon Marketing Agency reached out and wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards, and their trust that their site is optimized for search engines.
I revised the source code to place semantic HTML elements. When reviewing the structure of the HTML elements I made sure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I gave all images accessible alt attributes. To further help optimization I gave the page a concise, descriptive title.
